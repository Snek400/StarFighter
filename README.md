# StarFighter
A small game written in python with the pygame module.

There is a bash script to run it but this will only work on Linux systems. For Windows you should open it with Idle and run it with that.

Sometimes on Linux some of the correct modules are not installed. If this is the case, type the following into the command line:

sudo apt-get python-pip
[your password]
sudo pip install pygame

This should install the missing library.
